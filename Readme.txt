This project is a ToDoList with Christmas theme. It has the basic concepts of
a todolist like adding a task, marking it as complete or active, delete a task
or all of them and a warning message if you want to put an empty task.
If you think better when listening to music, you have a play button which plays
a Christmas song(Jingle Bells).
This project is carried out in 3 programming languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
